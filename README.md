Unit 1: Intoduction to HTML

What is HTML
- HTML is a crucial component in web technology, serving as a channel for various content types, bridging the gap between human and computer languages, and facilitating intelligent communication on the web.

The function of HTML
- HTML, CSS, and Javascript are three programming languages used in the Web. HTML marks content, provides built-in browser functionalities, and is a declarative language with simplicity, resilience, and robustness.
- CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a web page stylist responsible for color, font, and size, and can add animations and interactions. It is both power and fragile, if there is an error in the CSS code the browser is smart enough to skip it and move on to the code that works.
- JavaScript is a powerful programming language used to create interactive websites, but can be fragile if outdated browsers don't understand the code. The Web, created to function on various platforms and devices, relies on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for resilience and robustness. Developers use HTML for tasks that can be done in other languages, emphasizing the importance of learning HTML elements.

Unit 2: HTML Text Formatting

HTML Syntax
- HTML is a language used to structure web pages using tags, including opening and closing tags. It serves as a bridge between humans and computers, providing meaning to content and helping computers understand it. HTML elements can be nested within each other, creating a tree structure called a DOM tree. The choice of HTML elements impacts user experience, including accessibility.

HTML Paragraphs
- The paragraph element in Notepad++ and HTML window is not resembling paragraphs. To fix this, add an opening (P) and closing tag (/P) , and separate paragraphs with their own tags.

HTML Headlines
- Headlines are essential elements in web pages, dividing content into smaller, more digestible chunks. They act as clickable titles on landing pages and convey a sense of hierarchy in how the browser interprets and communicates about the page. Headlines come in six types: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6.
- The largest and most prominent element is h1, while the smallest and least attention-grabbing element is h6. Selecting the appropriate headline level is straightforward, starting with the opening tag and ending with the closing tag. This hierarchical system gives meaning to the browser and ensures all article headlines share the same type, ensuring consistency for screen reader users.

HTML Bold and Italics
- The four HTML elements - bold, italic, and bold - are used to emphasize text in a book or magazine. The use of bold is for making a strong point, while italic is used for visually distinguishing between words. In book publishing, journalism, and magazine production, rules dictate when to use bold or italic. In this case, italicizing the word "favorite" emphasizes the character, while italicizing the phrase "Sesame Street" is used to highlight the TV show title. The browser should understand when to verbally emphasize or visually distinguish between the two.
- In HTML, two elements can be used to emphasize or make something bold: the "strong" element, which shows importance, seriousness, or urgency, and the "b" element, which is more generic and neutral. The "strong" element is used to emphasize a specific part of a phrase or to make certain words bold without conveying any meaning. The "b" element is used to make certain phrases bold without holding any special significance for the browser or screen reader. CSS can be used to change the appearance of text to be bold.

HTML List
- Lists are a common aspect of daily life, including to-do lists, recipes, wish lists, and bucket lists. In HTML, there are three types of lists: unordered lists, ordered lists, and definition lists. Unordered lists are the most common, with each item enclosed in an "li" element. Indentation is optional but is used to convey meaning.
- Ordered lists are similar but with a specific order, with "ol" indicating a specific order.
- Definition lists, on the other hand, are used to create a key-value pair in computer science. The term or key is enclosed in "dt" tags, while the description or value is enclosed in "dd" tags. Multiple "dd" tags can be used for each term, and the entire list is wrapped in a "dl" tag. These tags are placed side by side without any additional wrapper, forming a structure that is unique to each list type.

HTML Quotes
- To quote a phrase, the phrase must be in the normal paragraph tag and the author of the quote is in the "cite" tag and we wrap the whole thing in a "blockquote" element.
- To use a quote that is said by someone and place it in semicolons we use the "q" element, which stands for quote.
- To provide additional information for the HTML, in this case the datetime attribute allows us to specify the date or time in a format. The format for the time within the datetime must be specific.

HTML Date and Time Input
- HTML simplifies programming by using a single element called "time" to mark specific moments or ranges in time. This element consists of an opening tag ("time") and a closing tag ("/time"). The "time" element conveys the exact date or time to computers using an HTML attribute called "datetime". The datetime attribute specifies the date or time in a machine-readable format, which is preferred by computers.
- Examples include May 8th as 05, 08, 2025-05-08. Machines prefer 24-hour clock format and can specify the time zone. The datetime attribute can also combine the date and time, with options for separating them using a T or leaving a space. These formatting rules apply to many programming languages and are acceptable and correct. By using the time element with its datetime attribute, we can convey the time in a way that computers can understand.

HTML Code, pre, br
- To showcase code on a webpage, use the code element to create a monospaced font and style it. By default, code is treated as an inline element, meaning it remains part of the sentence. To change the word "H4" into an actual H4 headline, type "<" as an HTML entity. This will display a less than sign and a greater than sign.
- For HTML entities, like br and pre elements, add spaces and line breaks to make code more readable without affecting the webpage's content. For example, to display a poem with irregular spacing, add a br element at the end of each line. This will make the poem look correct and the browser will recognize the line breaks.
- To display a code block with proper indentation, combine pre and code elements. For example, to make a piece of HTML using HTML entities, add indentation to the code and include CSS code, which is also indented.

HTML Superscript, subscript, small text
- Subscripts, superscripts, and small text are used to mark up specific content with different meanings. Subscripts are characters set below the normal baseline for text, while superscripts are characters set above the normal baseline. Mathematical formulas and footnotes often use superscripts.
- To handle subscripts and superscripts in HTML, use sub and sup elements. MathML is a specialized markup language for math, more powerful than HTML. Small text, such as copyright information, can be marked up with a small element to convey its low prominence. CSS can adjust text size to any desired size. However, small text can convey that something has very little prominence, like the fine print at the bottom of a page regarding ownership.
