Unit 1: Intoduction to HTML

What is HTML
- HTML is a crucial component in web technology, serving as a channel for various content types, bridging the gap between human and computer languages, and facilitating intelligent communication on the web.

The function of HTML
- HTML, CSS, and Javascript are three programming languages used in the Web. HTML marks content, provides built-in browser functionalities, and is a declarative language with simplicity, resilience, and robustness.
- CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a web page stylist responsible for color, font, and size, and can add animations and interactions. It is both power and fragile, if there is an error in the CSS code the browser is smart enough to skip it and move on to the code that works.
- JavaScript is a powerful programming language used to create interactive websites, but can be fragile if outdated browsers don't understand the code. The Web, created to function on various platforms and devices, relies on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for resilience and robustness. Developers use HTML for tasks that can be done in other languages, emphasizing the importance of learning HTML elements.

Unit 2: HTML Text Formatting

HTML Syntax
- HTML is a language used to structure web pages using tags, including opening and closing tags. It serves as a bridge between humans and computers, providing meaning to content and helping computers understand it. HTML elements can be nested within each other, creating a tree structure called a DOM tree. The choice of HTML elements impacts user experience, including accessibility.

HTML Paragraphs
- The paragraph element in Notepad++ and HTML window is not resembling paragraphs. To fix this, add an opening (P) and closing tag (/P) , and separate paragraphs with their own tags.

HTML Headlines
- Headlines are essential elements in web pages, dividing content into smaller, more digestible chunks. They act as clickable titles on landing pages and convey a sense of hierarchy in how the browser interprets and communicates about the page. Headlines come in six types: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6.
- The largest and most prominent element is h1, while the smallest and least attention-grabbing element is h6. Selecting the appropriate headline level is straightforward, starting with the opening tag and ending with the closing tag. This hierarchical system gives meaning to the browser and ensures all article headlines share the same type, ensuring consistency for screen reader users.

HTML Bold and Italics
- The four HTML elements - bold, italic, and bold - are used to emphasize text in a book or magazine. The use of bold is for making a strong point, while italic is used for visually distinguishing between words. In book publishing, journalism, and magazine production, rules dictate when to use bold or italic. In this case, italicizing the word "favorite" emphasizes the character, while italicizing the phrase "Sesame Street" is used to highlight the TV show title. The browser should understand when to verbally emphasize or visually distinguish between the two.
- In HTML, two elements can be used to emphasize or make something bold: the "strong" element, which shows importance, seriousness, or urgency, and the "b" element, which is more generic and neutral. The "strong" element is used to emphasize a specific part of a phrase or to make certain words bold without conveying any meaning. The "b" element is used to make certain phrases bold without holding any special significance for the browser or screen reader. CSS can be used to change the appearance of text to be bold.
